Startpage
========

A simple startpage to meet my needs.

![alt tag](Home.png "Startpage preview")

Based on [tayumpee's starpage 2](//github.com/tayumpee/start_page2_firefox_and_chrome) inspired by [Vallodes](https://www.reddit.com/u/vallode/) tutorial.

**Live Demo:** [Demo](http://ramenmaestro.github.io/startpage/)

This repository contains a custom startpage made using html, css and a little javascript. Feel free to download and modify. 
Comments and suggestions appreciated.
